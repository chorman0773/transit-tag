# Basic Rules


* Must use Public Transit (Busses, Metro, LRT, Street car, Monorail, etc.) or moving on foot to travel
* Must remain in the target transit system's main network
* Game is not in play between 20:00 and 09:00 - at the beginning of the rest period you must not be on any bus, and at the end you must be waiting at the same stop.
* When a person is tagged, the seeker becomes a runner and the tagged person becomes a seeker
* At the start of the game or someone is tagged, the seeker cannot tag anyone, use the tracker or move for 30 minutes
* Fast Transit (Express Busses, Metro, LRT, or Monorail) requires a powerup to use by the runners. The Chaser may use fast public transit for free.
    * Use means in one direction, the furthest between two terminuses. Continuing to remain on a Fast Transit Route at the Terminus where allowed is considered an additional "use" of the Route.s
* You start with 2 Powerups
* You can gain more by completing challenges.
* Each player must have location tracking via Google Maps on, and open on Mobile Data at all times throughout the game. 
* You may spend 5 powerups to turn off your tracker for 15 minutes.
* Spend 2 Powerups to block a stop. Other players cannot board a bus for 1 hour at that stop, and if they are on a bus when it stops at that stop they must disembark. Stop means a specific stop (or pair of stops) with a given name. It refers only to stops with that name, and not nearby stops (including those at the same intersection). If the stop is a transit terminal, costs 3 powerups instead. 
* Each player must have Lunch and Dinner while the game is in play, and stop (not be on transit or tag anyone) for 10 minutes each. These meals must be at least 3 hours apart, not within 1 hour of the beginning or end of the Rest Period, and must be complete.
* Challenges are randomly shuffled and may be drawn at any point. Once you draw a challenge you must complete it or veto it before drawing a new challenge. If you veto a challenge, you must get off whatever bus you are currently on at the next possible stop and cannot use transit for 30 minutes after doing so. After you veto a challenge willingly, if you draw the same challenge immediately after, you may discard it and draw a new challenge for free until the end of the veto period.
* At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has spent the most time as a runner.
